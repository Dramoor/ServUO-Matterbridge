# ServUO-Matterbridge
A matterbridge connector for ServUO servers.

This library will allow ServUO server owners to relay chat to and from any of the chat services that [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge) supports.

Please bring any issues up on the issue tracker here and I will do my best to fix them, but I can't guarantee any speed in doing so, nor can I guarantee that I will be able to offer support or entertain new feature requests.

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/kuoushi/ServUO-Matterbridge/wiki).
